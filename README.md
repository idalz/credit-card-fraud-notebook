## Project Overview
Analyzing the provided data to gain insights and create a neural network that predicts credit card fraud.

## Project Workflow

1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
   - Explore, manipulate, and visualize the data to gain insights.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Apply techniques such as feature scaling and SMOTE resampling to prepare the data.

3. **Model Selection**
   - Create different neural networks and train them using the data.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Utilize evaluation on the best ANN.
